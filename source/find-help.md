## Slack

The OpenFisca community gathers around a [Slack space](https://openfisca.slack.com), which you can ask to join by sending a mail to [contact@openfisca.org](mailto:contact@openfisca.org?subject=Slack).

This space provides both community and official support, and centralises all countries’ channels.

### Channels and naming conventions

In order to increase discoverability of channels and ease navigation, the following prefixes are used:

- `of-` channels are about quick discussions and requests for help on a technical module. To make decisions on changes to apply to these modules, we use GitHub issues and Pull Requests on dedicated repositories.
- `share-` channels are newsrooms on which everyone is encouraged to share their news, learnings and accomplishments  :)

For tax and benefit systems models, the following conventions are applied:

- Channels that centralise discussions around a specific tax and benefit system are given the name of the distributed module, suffixed by `-system`. _For example: `france-system`_. If that full name is too long for the Slack channel character limit, then a shortened version of the name is used.
- Channels that centralise discussions around extensions to tax and benefit systems are given that system’s module name, followed by `-ext-` and an identifier for that extension. _For example: `france-ext-paris`_.
- System-specific group channels are campfires around which some specific organisations of contributors to a tax and benefits system gather. When a country becomes large enough, it often happens that several employers of contributors work concurrently on different parts of the system, and the main `-system` channel would become unreadable. These channels are called that system’s module name, followed by `-org-` and an identifier for that group. _For example: `france-org-gouv`_.
